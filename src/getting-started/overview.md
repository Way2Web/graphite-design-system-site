# Getting started

<p class="intro">Welcome to Graphite! Graphite is Way2Web’s open-source white-label design system for digital products and experiences.</p>

Get started by following the guide for [designers](/getting-started/designers) or [developers](/getting-started/developers).

## Overview

A design system is a collection of pre-built, reusable assets—components, patterns, guidance, and code—that allows its users to build consistent digital experiences faster. By using the pre-built and universal assets of Graphite, the time teams spend designing and building is minimized. Instead of building and re-building basic elements, they can spend that time customizing their products to address specific client use cases.

Basically, it's a big box of UI Lego pieces, both in design assets & coded components, accompanied by standards and documentation. With a guide on why and how to use them.

## Graphite is open source

Graphite is funded and built by [Way2Web](https://www.way2web.nl), which means we build for the company’s business needs, but we’ve made it open source for anyone to use and contribute back to.

It's available under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/Way2Web/graphite-design-system/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Target platform

Graphite is mainly targeted at browser/desktop applications.

We make sure our components are usable on mobile browsers with touch input. But for mobile apps we recommend using [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) (with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/)) instead of Graphite. Because of their [adaptive styling](https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/platform-styles), Ionic apps look and feel at home on every device following the device guidelines while still offering some customization for branding. There are design kits available for [Sketch](https://ionicsketch.com/) & [Figma](https://ionicfigma.com/).

But using [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/), you can still use Graphite components for mobile apps if you want to, and even combine it with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/).

## Accessibility

The Graphite team is committed to providing a website and components that are accessible by all people, regardless of ability or situation.

We're continuosly working towards improving the accessibility of this website and our components to ensure we provide equal access to everyone.

This work is ongoing and we continue to strive towards our goal of promoting accessibility and meeting WCAG 2.1 level AA guidelines.

We welcome your feedback on how we might improve. For any specific questions or concerns, please [contact us](/help/contact-us).
